# Bamazon

*Bamazon* is an Amazon-like storefront that utilizes the node back-end command line and MySQL database. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory. The app also includes a Manager portal where a Manager (upon signing up for an account) can view product sales,  low inventory, add new inventory, and add new products. Also, the app's Supervisor component allows the Supervisor to view sales across the store's departments and generate a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store. 

### Here are some links demonstrating how the app works:
